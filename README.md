##Job Interview Problem

Create a UI on **React** to select and parse a CSV file from the computer.

Find the two employees that have worked the most days together on the same projects.

Represent the information in a table.

I am using [Papaparse](https://www.papaparse.com/) to parse the CSV and [Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) for the table style.
